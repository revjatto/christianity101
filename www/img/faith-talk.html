	   <h3>The Fight of Faith</h3>
        <blockquote>“We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak" (2 Corinthians 4:13)</blockquote>
		<p>Too many people have the idea that if something is God’s will for them to have that it will just automatically happen without any effort or involvement on their part.</p>

        <h3>Faith Speaks</h3>
        <p> The spirit of faith speaks! (Hebrews 11:1-2) It calls things that be not as though they were.</p>
		<p>“God’s Word is His covenant with His children. “…My Spirit is abiding in your midst; do not fear” (Paraphrased) Haggai 2:5</p>
		<p>“if you say [the word of faith] to the mountain” of problems that is standing before you “it will be done.” (Matt 23:21). God himself stands as the guarantee to fulfil the word of faith that you speak through your mouth. This is your heritage as a child of God.</p>
		<p>There's miraculous power in the Word of God. It is a seed that, once planted by faith in a human heart, will produce more blessings than one can imagine.</p>

        <ul>
		<p><li>I Cast all my care upon the Lord; for he cares for me.(1 Peter 5:7) My God has blessed me with every good thing I need to leave a victorious christian life, according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</li></p>
		<p><li>“No weapon formed against me shall prosper, and every tongue Which rises against me in judgment I condemn.(Isaiah 54:17) This is my heritage as a child of God Almighty, I am saved from wrath by Jesus christ and justified by His Blood.</li></p>
		<p><li>God has said, I will never leave you, nor forsake you. So I boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me." Hebrews 13:5-6</li></p>
		<p><li>From today, the burden of the wicked is taken away from off my shoulder, and his yoke from off my neck, and the yoke is destroyed because of the anointing from the anointed One." Isaiah 10:27)</li></p>
		<p><li>I do not allow the worries of this world or the deceitfulness of riches or the lusts of other things to enter into my heart and choke the Word. I am determined to bear much fruit. (Mark 4:19)</li></p>
		<p><li>The blessing of Abraham comes on me through Jesus Christ. I receive the promise of the Spirit through the faith. I am an heir to the promise! (Gal 3:14,29)</li></p>

		<p><li>The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures: He leads me beside the still waters. He restores my soul </li></p>

		<p><li>He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff they comfort me.</li></p>


		<p><li>	You prepare a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: You anoints my head with oil; my cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.</li></p>

        <h3>Praying Psalm 91</h3>
        <ul>
		<p><li>In the name of Jesus Christ, I take refuge under the Blood of Jesus christ and dwell in the secret place of the Most High. I declare right now, the LORD is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I put my trust.</li></p>
		<p><li>Surely He has delivered me from the snare of the fowler and from the perilous pestilence. He has covered me with His feathers, and under His wings I take refuge; His truth (His Word) is my shield and buckler. (Psalm 91:1-4)</li></p>
		<p><li>I am not afraid of the terror by night, Nor of the arrow that flies by day, Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday. A thousand may fall at my side, and ten thousand at my right hand; But it shall not come near me and my children. Only with my eyes shall I look, and see the reward of the wicked.(Psalm 91:5-8)</li></p>
		<p><li>Because I have made the Lord, who is my refuge, Even the Most High, my dwelling place, No evil shall befall me (No sickness or disease shall afflict my body), nor shall any plague come near my dwelling; I reject sickness and diseases in my body, soul or spirit. (Psalm 91:9-10)</li></p>
		<p><li>For the LORD has commanded His angels to protect me in all my ways. In their hands they shall lift me up, lest I dash my foot against a stone. (Psalm 91:11-12)</li></p>
		<p><li>In the name of Jesus Christ I tread upon the lion and the cobra, the young lion and the serpent I trample underfoot.(Psalm 91:13)</li></p>
		<p><li>Because I have set my love upon Jesus Christ, therefore He will deliver me; He will set me on high, because I have known His name. When I call upon Him, He will answer me; He will be with me in trouble; He will deliver me and honour me. With long life will He satisfy me, and show me His salvation. (Psalm 91:14-16)(Paraphrase)</li></p>

        <h3>Praying Isaiah 54</h3>
        <ul>
		<p><li>For this is like the waters of Noah to Me; For as I have sworn that the waters of Noah would no longer cover the earth, so have I sworn that I would not be angry with you, nor rebuke you. Says the LORD.</li></p>
		<p><li>For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed, but My kindness shall not depart from you, nor shall My covenant of peace be removed,” Says the Lord, who has mercy on you.</li></p>
		<p><li>“O you afflicted one, Tossed with tempest, and not comforted, Behold, I will lay your stones with colorful gems, and lay your foundations with sapphires.</li></p>
		<p><li>I will make your pinnacles of rubies, Your gates of crystal, and all your walls of precious stones. All your children shall be taught by the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children.</li></p>
		<p><li>In righteousness you shall be established; You shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear; And from terror, for it shall not come near you. Indeed they shall surely assemble, but not because of Me. Whoever assembles against you shall fall for your sake.</li></p>
		<p><li>“Behold, I have created the blacksmith Who blows the coals in the fire, Who brings forth an instrument for his work; And I have created the spoiler to destroy.</li></p>
		<p><li>No weapon formed against me shall prosper, and I condemn every tongue which rises against me in judgment. This is my heritage as a child of the Most High, and my righteousness is from the Lord.”</li></p>
