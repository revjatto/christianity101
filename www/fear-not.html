        <blockquote>“But now, this is what the Lord says… Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine.” Isaiah 43:1</blockquote>
        
    <p>Fear! One of the enemy’s most popular weapons that he uses against us.  Worry, anxiety, fear…can overwhelm us with a thick shadow of darkness, controlling our every move and decision.</p><br>
        
<p>So much crazy going on around us today - wars, conflicts, persecution, violence, crime, natural disasters, terrorism, economic uncertainty, unemployment, divisions, disease, death.   We fear for our children’s future, we fear for our families, we fear for our financial future, we fear for our safety.  The list goes on…long.  There actually is a lot we could potentially worry about.</p><br>
        
<p>Yet reality tells us that so much of what we spend our time worrying about never even happens.  Living under the weight of the "what if's" is a hard place to dwell. </p><br>

    
    <h3>33 Verses to Remind Us - We Do Not Have to Fear:</h3><br>

<p>21. “God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.” Psalm 46:1</p><br>
<p>22. “The Lord is with me; I will not be afraid.  What can man do to me?  The Lord is with me; he is my helper.” Psalm 118:6-7</p><br>

<p>32. “The Lord your God is in your midst, A victorious warrior. He will exult over you with joy, He will be quiet in His love, He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy.” Zephaniah 3:17</p><br>
<p>33. “He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.  I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.”…He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.  You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday.</p><br>  <p>A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you…For he will command his angels concerning you, to guard you in all your ways…“Because he loves me,” says the Lord, “I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name.  He will call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him…” from Psalm 91:1-16</p><br>
<p>Be assured, He is with you in whatever you face, in the turmoil and struggles, amidst the anxious thoughts and the worries of life.  He is there, strengthening, helping, and He holds you in His hands.</p><br>
<p>God is greater.  He gives us the power to live courageously, boldly, fearlessly in this life, when many things that surround us would tell us to be afraid.  His truth whispers strong and sure to the deepest core of our spirits.</p><br>

        <center><p><b>“Do not fear. I am with you”</b></p></center><br>
<p>All of that stuff on your mind?  Give it to Him – again.  Replace those fearful thoughts with His words of truth. And sleep in peace tonight.  He knows what concerns you, He’s got you covered.</p><br>
