“I confess all my sins before You and hold nothing back. Especially I confess …. ”</p>

<p><b>6. Break with the occult and all false religion:</b><br/>

<h3>Prayer of release from curses</h3>
<p>Thank you, Lord Jesus, that on the cross You were made a curse that I might be redeemed from the curse and enter into the blessing. And because of what You did, Lord Jesus, in Your precious Name I release myself from every curse over me and my family and I claim the blessing that You purchased for me with Your blood. Thank you, Lord Jesus.” Blessed be your Holy Name! </p>

<p>Heavenly Father, I come to you in the Name that is above every other name. In the Name of Your Holy Son, Jesus Christ, I come to you sincerely with a desire to be free from the influence of all generational curses in my life. </p>

<p>I declare that because of what Jesus Christ did for me on the cross of Calvary, I am cleansed and covered by the precious blood of Jesus and the devil has no power over me. </p>

<p>I now confess all my sins, known and unknown. I repent of them right now in the Name of Jesus Christ and ask you to forgive me and help me to take back any jurisdiction I may have forfeited to the enemy. </p>

<p>I also acknowledge the sins of all my forefathers. In the Name of Jesus and by the blood of the Lamb, I break and renounce the power of every demonic curse that was passed down to me through the sins and actions of my forefathers. I break the power and the hold of every curse that came to me through my sins and the sins of my forefathers. </p>

<p>In the Name of Jesus, I break the power and hold of every curse that came to me through words spoken by my mother, father or teachers at school. </p>

<p>I break the power and hold of every curse that came to me through disobedience of mine and my forefathers in worshiping other gods. </p>

<p>In the Name of Jesus, I renounce, break, and loose myself and my family from all demonic strongholds, psychic powers, bondage’s, bonds of inherited, physical or mental illnesses or curses upon me and my family line as a result of sins, transgressions, iniquities, occult or psychic involvement by any member of my family line, living or dead. </p>

<p>In the Name of Jesus, I declare every legal hold and all legal ground of the enemy broken and destroyed. Satan no longer has jurisdiction to harass me or my family line through generational curses. </p>

<p>Through the blood of Jesus, I am free! Thank you, Heavenly Father, for setting me free! I confess that my body, soul, and spirit are the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. I am redeemed, cleansed, sanctified, and justified by the blood of Jesus. </p>

<p>Thank you, Heavenly father for setting me free. I surrender my will to you. Use me in this end-time hour as a member of your victorious army to win souls for your glory in Jesus Mighty Name. AMEN! </p>

<p>Praise the name of the Lord forever and ever! Glory to God in the Heaven! </p>

<p>Praise the Lord! Hallelujah!!
