        <h3>My Helmet of Salvation</h3>
        <p>I believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the only way to God; I believe He was crucified on the cross and the third day He rose again from the dead. I believe He is seated at the right of hand of God the Father, far above all principalities and powers. I believe He is Lord God Almighty, the creator of the universe, the everlasting Father and the Prince of Peace. He is the King of kings and the Lord of lords. He is the Judge of the whole earth.</p>
		<p> I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus my Lord. (Romans 8:38-39) </p>
		<p>“For God so loved me, he gave his one and only Son so that I would not perish but have everlasting life.”</p>
		<p>The Spirit of the Lord leads and guides me in all my ways.</p>
		<p>I believe in Christ Jesus, I am a son/daughter of God redeemed from the hand of the devil through the blood of Jesus.</p>

        <h3>Protection - Confession</h3>
        <p>In the name of Jesus Christ, I take refuge under the Blood of Jesus Christ and dwell in the secret place of the Most High. I declare right now, the LORD is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I put my trust. Surely He has delivered me from the snare of the fowler and from the perilous pestilence.
		He has covered me with His feathers, and under His wings I take refuge; His truth, (His Word) is my shield and buckler.</P><BR/>
		<P>I am not afraid of the terror by night, Nor of the arrow that flies by day, Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday. A thousand may fall at my side, and ten thousand at my right hand; But it shall not come near me and my children. Only with my eyes shall I look, and see the reward of the wicked.</p>
		<p>Because I have made the Lord, who is my refuge, Even the Most High, my dwelling place, No evil shall befall me (No sickness or disease shall afflict my body), nor shall any plague come near my dwelling; I reject sickness and diseases in my body, soul or spirit. (Psalm 91:9-10)</p>

	  <p>“There is no one like the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the King of glory, Who rides the heavens to help us, And in His Excellency on the clouds.  The eternal God is our refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms; He will thrust out the enemy from before us, and will say, ‘Destroy!’ Then everyone that trust in Him shall dwell in safety, the fountain of Jacob alone, in a land of grain and new wine; our heavens shall also drop dew. Happy are you, O children of the Most High! Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD, The shield of your help. And the sword of your majesty!  Your enemies (sickness and diseases)shall submit to you, and you shall tread down their high places.” Deu 33:26-29</p>

        <h3>Healing Confession!</h3>
        <p>Jesus was wounded for my transgressions, He was bruised for my iniquities; the chastisement for my peace was laid upon Him, and by His stripes I am healed..</p>
		<p>Sickness is not from God, He is not using it to punish me, it is demonic and I resolutely reject any form of sickness from my body, soul and spirit in the name of Jesus.</p>

        <h3>Confession For Favor!</h3>
        <p>I believe in my heart and confess with my mouth: I will eat in plenty and be satisfy, and praise the name of the Lord my God, who has dealt wondrously with me; and I will never be put to shame. For my God shall supply my needs according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</p>
		<p>I put my trust in the Lord, the maker of heaven and earth; therefore I shall be established forever, the power of wickedness shall not rule over me and my family in the name of Jesus Christ my Lord. As mountain surround Jerusalem so the Lord surround me and my family with His loving-kindness and tender mercy even now and forever.</p>
