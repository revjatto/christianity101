      <blockquote>
    “My son, give attention to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.  Do not let them depart from your eyes; keep them in the midst of your heart;  For they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh.  Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life” PROVERBS 4:20-23
      </blockquote>

      <p>God’s Word is medicine — for any weakness or sickness in your body, mind, finances, family, marriage, etc.</p><br/>

<p>Whatever sickness or disease you suffer from, God’s Word can cure it. God’s Word is effective for any condition. It works as a preventative as well as a cure. There is no cost and no danger of taking an overdose.</p><br/>

<p>Like any medicine, God’s Word must be taken to be effective. It will not work sitting on the shelf. And it has to be taken according to the directions.</p><br/>
      <p>Here are the directions:</p><br/>

  <h2>Healing Scriptures</h2>

<p>(1 John 5:14-15 KJV)And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:…And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.</p><br/>

<p>(Heb 12:12-13 KJV)Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;…And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.</p><br/>

<p>(Rom 8:31 KJV)What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</p><br/>

<p>(Mal 3:6 KJV)For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.</p><br/>

<p>(Isa 41:10 KJV)Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.</p><br/>

<p>(Jer 30:17 KJV)For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</p><br/>

<p>(Jer 33:6 KJV)Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.</p><br/>

<p>(Deut 30:19-20 KJV)I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:…That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.</p><br/>

<p>(Lev 26:3 KJV)If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;…(Lev 26:9 KJV)For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.</p><br/>

<p>(Isa 58:8 KJV)Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward.</p><br/>

<p>(2 Ki 20:5 KJV) Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.</p><br/>

<p>(Num 23:19 KJV)God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?</p><br/>

<p>(2 Chr 6:14 KJV)And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and showest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:</p><br/>

<p>(2 Chr 16:9 KJV)For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.</p><br/>

<p>(Psa 145:8-9 KJV)The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy….The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.</p><br/>

<p>(Psa 30:2 KJV)O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.</p><br/>

<p>(Psa 34:19 KJV)Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.</p><br/>

<p>(Psa 41:3 KJV)The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.</p><br/>

      <p>(Psa 42:11 KJV) Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.</p><br/>

 <p>(Mat 7:11 KJV) If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</p><br/>

 <p>(Isa 53:4-5 KJV) Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted….But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.</p><br/>

 <p>(Mat 8:17 KJV) That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.</p><br/>
        
        <img class="full-image" src="img/holy-bible.jpg"><br>

( <p>1 Pet 2:24 KJV) Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.</p><br/>

 <p>(Gal 3:13,14,29 KJV) Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:…That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith….And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.</p><br/>

 <p>(Col 1:12-14 KJV) Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:…Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:…In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:</p><br/>

 <p>(Col 2:10,15 KJV)And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:…And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</p><br/>

 <p>(Heb 9:12 KJV)Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</p><br/>

 <p>(1 Chr 29:28 KJV)And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</p><br/>

 <p>(Job 5:26 KJV)Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in his season.</p><br/>

 <p>(Psa 90:10 KJV)The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</p><br/>

 <p>(Psa 91:10-16 KJV )There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling….For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways….They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone….Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet….Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name….He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him….With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation.</p><br/>

 <p>(Prov 3:1-2 KJV)My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:…For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</p><br/>
