<p>(Mat 8:2-3 KJV) And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean….And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</p><br/>

<h2>Jesus Heals a Centurion’s Servant</h2><br>

<p>(Mat 8:5-10,13 KJV) And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,…And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented….And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him….The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed….</p><br/>
<p>For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it….When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel….And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.</p><br/><br>

<h2>Peter’s Mother-in-law Healed</h2><br>

<p>(Mat 8:14-17 KJV) And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother laid, and sick of a fever….And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them….When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:…That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.</p><br/><br>

<h2>Woman with issue of Blood Healed</h2><br>

<p>(Mat 9:20-22 KJV) And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:…For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole….But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.</p><br/>

<h2>Two Blind Men Healed and a Mute Man Speaks</h2><br>

<p>(Mat 9:27-36 KJV) And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us….And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this?</p><br/>
<p> They said unto him, Yea, Lord….Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you….And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it….But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country….As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil….And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel….But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils….</p><br>
<p>And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people….But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.</p><br/>

<blockquote> Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest….Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls….For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.(Mat 11:28-30 KJV)</blockquote>

<p>(Mat 12:15 KJV) But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;</p><br/><br>

(Mat 14:13-14 KJV) When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities….And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.</p><br/><br>

<p>(Mat 14:34-36 KJV) And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret….And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;…And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.</p><br/><br>

<p>(Mat 15:29-31 KJV) And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there….And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:…Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</p><br/><br>

<h2>A Demon-Possessed Man Healed.A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed of Blood Disease</h2><br>

             <p>(Mark 5:1-43 KJV)And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes….And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,…Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:…Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him….And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones….</p><br/>
             <p>But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,…And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not….For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit….And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many….And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country….Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding….And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them….And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea….And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done….</p><br/>
             <p>And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid….And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine….And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts….And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him….</p><br/>
             <p>Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee….And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel….And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea….And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,…And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: </p><br/>
             <p>I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live….And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him….And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,…And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,…When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment….</p><br/><br>
             <p><b>For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole….And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague….</b> And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?…And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?…</p><br/><br>
             
             <p>And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing….But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth….<b>And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague….</b></p><br/><br>

             <p>While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why trouble thou the Master any further?…As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, <b>Be not afraid, only believe….</b><br>
                 <p>And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James….And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly….And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleeps….And they laughed him to scorn.</p><br/><br>
             <p>But when He had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying….And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise….And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment….And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.</p><br/><br>

<p>(Mark 6:53-56 KJV)And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore….And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,…And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was….And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</p><br/><br>

          <h2>A Gentile Shows Her Faith and Jesus Heals a Deaf Mute</h2><br>

<p>(Mark 7:25-37 KJV) For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:…The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter….But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it unto the dogs….And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs….And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter….And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed….And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis….</p><br/>
<p>And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him….And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;…And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened….And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain….And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;…And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</p><br/>

             <h2>A Boy is Healed of a dumb spirit</h2><br>

<p>(Mark 9:17-29 KJV) And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;…And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not….He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me….And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming….And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child….And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him:</p><br/>
<p> but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us….Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth….And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief….When Jesus saw that the people came running together, <br><br>He rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him….And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead….</b></p><br/>

<p>But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose….And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?…And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.</p><br/>

<p>(Luke 4:16-21 KJV) And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read….And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,…The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,…To preach the acceptable year of the Lord….And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him….And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.</p><br/>

             <h2>Jesus Casts Out an Unclean Spirit</h2><br>

<p>(Luke 4:33-36 KJV)And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,… Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God….And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not….And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.</p><br/>

<p>(Luke 4:40-41 KJV)Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them….And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.</p><br/>

            <h2> Healing on the Sabbath (man with a withered hand)</h2><br>

<p>(Luke 6:6-10 KJV)And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered….And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him….But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth….Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?…And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</p><br/><br>

<p>(Luke 6:17-19 KJV)And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;…And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed….And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.</p><br/><br>
