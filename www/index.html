<h3>Powerful Healing Prayer</h3>
<p><b>Hear what God says in 3 John : 2:</b>

  "Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospers.”</p>

<p>Every born again child of God has a covenant of divine health with the Father, and you have a right to this covenant. God said; “..I am the Lord that healeth thee”</p><hr>

<h3>21 Powerful Confession!</h3>
<p>I’ve seen God’s Word change self-centered, narcissistic men who abuse and misuse women into godly husbands, wonderful dads, and upstanding citizens in the community.</p>
<p>God’s Word will never change your life until you let it become personal. It’s not about your neighbour, your friend, your spouse, or the stranger down the street. God’s Word must be applied to your life. The Bible won’t become dynamic until it becomes specific.</p>
      <p>According to Jesus Christ Our Lord, if you have faith; you will do something.  You will speak! Faith and authority are exercised through words. You must open your mouth and speak in line with what God says.</p><hr>

<h3>World Peace is Possible</h3>
      <p>We are deeply aware of the tragic cycle of continuing violence around the world. As we each find our own way through the complex maze of inner feelings, it is useful to know that we are not alone in our struggles or in our hopes.</p>
<p>It is possible to have peace in this world...</p><hr>

<a href="pauline-prayers.html"><img class="full-image" height="300" src="img/wisdom-from-god.jpg"></a>
<h3>Wisdom from God</h3>
<p>Wisdom is laying hold on the ways of God, God’s approach to every issue of life. It is knowing from God’s Word which way to go and how to handle situations to make them produce desired results. Wisdom is knowing how to make it in life!</p>
<p>I want to define supernatural wisdom as the supernatural ability to bring solutions to dark matters too difficult for the human mind.</p>
<p>Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established: Proverbs 24:3</p>

<h3>Holy Communion</h3>
<p>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him.  John 6:53, 55-56</p><hr>

      <h3>Powerful Christian Confession</h3>

church, become the places where men find Christ.</p>
