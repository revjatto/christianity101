  <blockquote> "Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. 12 His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had[a] a name written that no one knew except Himself. 13 He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God" Revelation 19:13.</blockquote>

<p>God has prescribed or "sent His Word" [Jesus Christ] to heal us and deliver us out of all our destructions". Psalms 107:20</p><br>

<p>You must be diligent to take your healing prescription daily or more frequently till you receive your cure. The invisible Godhead becomes visible in Jesus Christ.</p><br>

<p>Jesus is the exact representation of God's nature, the image of the invisible God, and the Word of God made flesh. Jesus said, "The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life". John 6:63</p><br>
      
      <h3>The next page will show you how to take God's medicine daily.</h3><br>
      
      <p>If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land.”
(Isaiah 1:19, The Amplified Bible)</p><br>
      
      <p>God has always promised that if you are willing and obedient, you will eat the good of the land. Understand though, that being willing means more than just saying, “Well, Lord, if You want me to be healed, I’ll be healed.” Being willing means that you apply the force of your will and determine to receive by faith what God has promised, no matter how impossible the circumstances may seem to be. </p>
      
      <blockquote>I will be healed and live in good health the rest of my life in the Name of Jesus, and I resist the curse of sickness and poverty. God says He has provided healing for me through Jesus Christ, His Son,  so healing and good health belong to me. I receive it now!” </blockquote>
      
      <p>That’s the kind of aggressive stand you need to establish God’s healing in your life. </p><br>
      
      <p>Here are 41 healing scriptures and prayers that will lift you out of your sick bed forever, or keep you healthy all the days of your life. </p>
