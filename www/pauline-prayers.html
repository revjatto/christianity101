            <h3>Praying Ephesians 1:16-23!</h3>
            <p>I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto me the spirit of Wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of Him,</p>
            <p>the eyes of my understanding being enlightened; that I may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion,</p>
            <p> and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come. And He put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. Ephesians 1:16-23</p>

            <h3>Praying Colossians 1:9-14 !</h3>
            <p>I pray to the God and Father our Lord Jesus Christ that I may be filled with the knowledge of Your will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</p>
            <p>that I may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God; strengthened with all might,</p>
            <p>according to His glorious power, for all patience and longsuffering with joy; giving thanks to the Father who has qualified me to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light.</p>
            <p> He has delivered me from the power of darkness and translated me into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins. </p></br/>

            <p>I am confident of this very thing, that God who has begun a good work in me will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ. Philippians 1:6 </p>

            <h3>Praying Ephesians 3:14-21!</h3>
            <p>For this reason I kneel before the Father, from whom the whole family in heaven and on earth derives its name.

            I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen me with power through his Spirit in my inner being, so that Christ may dwell in my hearts through faith.</p>

            <p>I pray that I, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge-that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.</p><br/>

            <p>Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.  </p>

            <h3>Praying Philippians 1:9-11!</h3>
            <p>And this I pray, that my love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment, that I may approve the things that are excellent, that I may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ, being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</p><br/>

            <p>I pray without ceasing that the God of peace Himself would sanctify me through and through, that is, separate me from profane things, make me pure and wholly consecrated to You, God and that my whole spirit, soul and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Thess 5:17,23 </p>
