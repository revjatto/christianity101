  <blockquote> "And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body. And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it. And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many (Mk.14:22-24). He told them â€œmy flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed" (Jn.6:55).</blockquote>
<p>"I am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world." John 6:48-51</p>
<p>Because the life of the flesh is in the blood, the strength, vigour and vitality that Christ exemplified and manifested becomes your portion as you drink His blood. It infuses eternal life into your system.</p>
