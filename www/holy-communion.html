  <blockquote> "And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body. And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it. And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many (Mk.14:22-24). He told them “my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed" (Jn.6:55).</blockquote>
<p>"I am that bread of life. Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world." John 6:48-51</p><br>
<p>Because the life of the flesh is in the blood, the strength, vigour and vitality that Christ exemplified and manifested becomes your portion as you drink His blood. It infuses eternal life into your system.</p><br>
        
<p>Everything that is disobeying the law of discipline has more to it than the human strength can handle. You need to appreciate the spiritual force of freedom. That is your only way out; otherwise when you are caught and wedged-in by any of these strange influences stronger than your natural ability, you are eternally helpless.<br><br>
<b>Principalities and powers are involved – organised, commanded and regimented by Satan himself.</b></p><br>
<p>The involvement of Satan in the corruption of man makes it humanly impossible for man to free himself. There is no accused person who can post bail for himself. Every time you are caught-up in sin, you are under arrest.</p>
<center>
<p>You need a recognised authority to bail you.</p>
<br>
<p>The Blood of Jesus, is that authority!</p>
</center>
        <br>
<p>The blood of Jesus is your guarantee for bail, it offers you the privilege of being discharged and acquitted, so that you can walk in liberty all the days of your life.</p><br>
        
<p>The Blood of Jesus is the divine provision for man’s freedom from every satanic dimension of corruption. It is what it takes to silence the opposition. It is the ultimate for our victory.</p>
<br>

<p>God has nothing extra to offer after the blood. When the blood came on the scene in Exodus chapter 12, Pharaoh gave up. The blood is God’s last card!</p>
<br>

<blockquote>“As for you also, because of the covenant I have with you sealed with blood, I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.  Return to the stronghold (to the secret place of the Most High), you prisoners of hope. Even today I declare that I will restore double to you.  

    Zech. 9:11-12</blockquote>
        
<p>Every time you plead, “The Blood of Jesus!”, you are bringing God’s very life on the scene.What makes the blood produce is the very life of God that is being invoked, because the life of the flesh is in the blood (Lev17:11). Whatever Jesus is, His blood is.</p><br>
        
<p>The blood of Jesus is a singular devastating weapon against Satan. He has not got an answer to it and never will.
All that was needed to keep him off is that it must be a lamb without blemish, and Jesus knew no sin (I Peter1:18-19). He was the most worthy of all the lambs that effected passover, and He thus became our eternal Passover lamb. So with our Passover blood in place, Satan is eternally helpless.</p>
