 <p>Speak these Words of God over your life daily and you will activate the Power of God on your behalf to live free of harrassment in your Christian life.</p>

 <blockquote>   “We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.” (2 Corinthians 4:13)</blockquote>

<p>The spirit of faith speaks! It calls things that be not as though they were. It makes faith confessions-not because it’s supposed to” or out of desperation, but because it’s so full of eager anticipation and confident expectation, it can’t keep its mouth shut! Stir up the spirit of faith that’s in you. Confess over that situation. speak life and not death!</p><br>



<p> Don’t leave yourself open to satanic attack, confess the Word of God over yourself   and your love ones every day. I have personalised Psalm 91 for you. I confess this scripture every day. No evil shall befall me or my children, because the Lord God almighty is watching over us. Confidence is contagious. Through this scripture you will develop confidence in the saving power of our God.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>Pray Psalm 91 for daily protection</h2><br>
        
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, I dwell in the secret place of the Most High and I abide under the shadow of the Almighty.</p>

<p>I declare right now, Jesus Christ is my Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I put my trust.</p>
<br>
<p>Surely He has delivered me from the snare of the fowler and from the perilous pestilence. He has covered me with His feathers, and under His wings I take refuge; His truth (His Word) is my shield and buckler.</p><br>
      
<p>I am not afraid of the terror by night, Nor of the arrow that flies by day,   Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.</p><br>

<p>A thousand may fall at my side, and ten thousand at my right hand; But it shall not come near me and my children. Only with my eyes shall I look, and see the reward of the wicked. Because I have made the Lord, who is my refuge, Even the Most High, my dwelling place, No evil shall befall me, nor shall any plague come near my dwelling; I will never be put to shame.</p><br>
<img src="img/engraved.jpg" class="full-image" height="400"><br><br>
<p>For the LORD has commanded His angels to protect me in all my ways. In their hands they shall lift me up, lest I dash my foot against a stone. In the name of Jesus Christ I tread upon the lion and the cobra, the young lion and the serpent I trample underfoot.</p><br>

<p>Because I have set my love upon Jesus Christ, therefore He will deliver him; He will  set me on high, because I have known His name. When I call upon the name of  Jesus, He will answer me; He will be with me in trouble; He will deliver me  and honour me. With long life will He satisfy me, and show me His salvation. </p>  </p><br>

      <p>“God’s Word is His covenant   with His children. “…My Spirit is abiding in your midst; do not fear” Haggai 2:5 </p>

<p><b>Never forget:</b></p>

 <blockquote>   “Death and life are in   the power of the tongue, And those who love it will eat its fruit.” (Pro   18:21)<br><br>

    “…Power belongs to   God.” (Psalm   62:11)<br><br>

    “if you say [the word   of faith] to the mountain” of problems that is standing before you   “it will be done.” (Matt 23:21)</blockquote>

<p>God himself stands as the guarantee to fulfil the word of faith that you speak through your mouth. This is your heritage as a child of God.</p>
