        <h3>Psalm 18</h3>
        <ul>
        <p><li>I will love You, O Lord, my strength.
                    The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer;
                    My God, my strength, in whom I will trust;
                    My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
                    I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised;
                    So shall I be saved from my enemies.</li></p>

                    <p><li>You have delivered me from the strivings of the people; You have made me the head of the nations; A people I have not known shall serve me.		</li></p>

                    <p><li>As soon as they hear of me they obey me; The foreigners submit to me. The foreigners fade away, And come frightened from their hideouts.	</li></p>


                    <p><li>The Lord lives! Blessed be my Rock! Let the God of my salvation be exalted.</li></p>

                    <p><li>It is God who avenges me, and subdues the peoples under me; He delivers me from my enemies.</li></p>
                    <p><li>You also lift me up above those who rise against me; You have delivered me from the violent man.</li></p>

                    <p><li>Therefore I will give thanks to You, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and sing praises to Your name.</li></p>

        <h3>Psalm 107</h3>
        <p>Thanksgiving to the Lord for His Great Works of Deliverance From the power of Darkness</p>
        <p>Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, Whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy..</p>

        <p>I am redeemed by the blood of Jesus out of the hand of the enemy, therefore I boldly say, the Lord is good and His mercy and kindness toward me and my family endures forever.</p>

        <h3>The Lord's Name is to be praised</h3>
        <p> Blessed are you O Lord our God, King of the universe who has kept us alive, maintain us and brought us to this time. </p>
        <p>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and mercy; and the God (who is the source) of every comfort (Consolation and encouragement). 2Conrinthians 1:3</p>
                <p>Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever.</p>

                  <p>Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, Whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy, And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south.</p>
