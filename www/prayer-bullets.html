    <h3>Daily Prayer Bullets</h3>
       <blockquote>And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. Rev. 12:10-11</blockquote>
        
<p>Our Father in heaven hallow be your name. I thank you for the precious Blood of Jesus Christ, the blood without blemish or spot. I that you that the blood of Jesus is pleading my case in heaven right now. Therefore I plead the blood of Jesus against the devil and all his plans to stop me from living holy today.</p><br>

<p>Holy Father, because of the covenant I have with you sealed with the precious blood of Jesus Christ my Lord. Let the blood of Jesus Christ protect me and my family from all evil of this day. Protect us from the snare of the devil and from perilous pestilence. Protect us from the evil that flies by day or the destruction that walks in the darkness. Let no evil befall us in any shape or form. Lead us not into temptation and deliver us from all evil by the power of your name and the blood of Jesus Christ our Lord and saviour.</p><br>

<p>I plead the Blood of Jesus Christ, my Lord, to protect my household and our possessions from all evil.</p><br>

<p>Through the Blood of Jesus Christ, my Lord, I am redeemed out of the hand of the devil.</p><br>

<p>Through the Blood of Jesus Christ, my Lord, all my sins are forgiving and I am continually been cleansed from all unrighteousness.</p><br>

<p>Through the Blood of Jesus I now have healing and health in my body because Jesus bore my griefs, sicknesses, diseases, weaknesses, distresses and pains. By His stripes I am healed. (Isaiah 53:4-5; I Peter 2:24; Matthew 8:16-17; Galatians 3:13-14)</p><br>

<p>Through the Blood of Jesus I have been redeemed from the curse of lack and poverty, for Jesus Himself bore the chastisement needful to obtain peace, prosperity and total well-being* for me. Though Jesus was so very rich, yet for my sake he became so very poor on the cross, in order that by His poverty I might become abundantly supplied. (Isaiah 53:4-5; II Corinthians 8:9)</p><br>

<p>Arise O Lord our God, let the fire of Antisemitism burning all over the world be quenched in the mighty name of Jesus Christ our Lord.</p><br>

<p>Father in the name of Jesus Christ my Lord, through the Blood of Jesus, redeem my life from destruction and cleanse me from all act of unrighteousness. Lead me not into temptation O Lord and deliver me from all evil. Create in me a clean heart O God and give me a steadfast spirit. Do not take your Holy Spirit from me. In fact, pour out your Spirit upon me exceedingly and more abundantly.</p><br>

<p>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and mercy; and the God (who is the source) of every comfort (consolation and encouragement) 2 conrinthians 1:3</p><br>

<blockquote>Blessed are You, O Lord our God, King of the Universe who has kept us alive, maintained us and brought us to this time.</blockquote>
      
<p>I pray to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory; be merciful onto me and my family and bless us, make your face to shine on us. So that your ways may be known on the earth and your salvation among the nation’s.</p><br>

<p>Revive us O Lord, according to your loving kindness. According to the multitude of your tender mercy, blot out our transgressions, cleanse your church with the precious Blood of Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour. Our help is in the name of the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. Ps. 124 May the Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be upon me and my family even now and forever. May the light of God shine in my heart and the hearts of my family in Jesus mighty name.</p><br>

<p>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed me with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ.</p><br>

<p>I believe in my heart and I confess with my mouth: I shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord my God, Who has dealt wondrously with me; and I will never be put to shame. For my God shall supply my needs according to His glory in Christ Jesus. Joel 2:26</p><br>

<p>I have God’s ability, because I have God’s nature. I have dwelling in me the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead. I have taken Jesus as my Lord and saviour. I will not be put to shame in my life, never again, because I put my trust in Jesus Christ my Lord and saviour.</p><br>

<p>I AM like mount Zion that cannot be moved but be established forever. As mountains surround Jerusalem so the Lord surround me with His grace and His loving kindness even now and forever. Amen.</p><br>

<p>God made Jesus to be sin on my behalf that I might be made the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.</p><br>

        <p><b>Putting on helmet of salvation:</b></p><br>

<p>I believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the only way to God. I believe He is Lord God Almighty. The everlasting Father and the prince of peace. I believe He was crucified on the cross and the third day He rose again from the dead. I believe He is seated at the right hand of God the Father and I am seated with Him in the heavenly places, far above all principalities and powers… I am above all the powers of darkness. They are under my feet. I believe I am a joint heir with Christ and I reign in life as a king.</p><br>

<p>I Believe Jesus Christ took my infirmities and carried my diseases. By His stripes I am healed. Therefore, I claim my total healing now, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ my Lord and saviour. This is my heritage as a son of God Almighty.</p><br>

<p>I believe through the Blood of Jesus I am Redeemed from the curse of poverty and sickness. Therefore I claim the power and wisdom to prosper.</p><br>

<p>I believe God the Father Has delivered me from the authority of the Kingdom of darkness and He has transferred me to the kingdom of His dear Son, Jesus Christ. I believe I am strong in the Lord and the power of His might. In the name of Jesus Christ my Lord, I believe I am strong and healthy.</p><br>

<p>I believe my back is healed. I believe I have good eyesight. I believe I have sound mind. Because Jesus Christ was wounded for my transgression, He was bruised for my iniquities. The chastisement for my peace was laid on Him.</p><br>

<p>By His stripes I am healed. Thank you my saviour Jesus Christ.</p><br>

<p>I believe I am GOOD; for everything God created is good. There is no evil in me for I am born of God and I have overcome the world because greater is He who is me than he who is in the world. </p><br>
        
<p>I believe I am anointed to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit and to set the captive free from all oppression of the devil.. I believe life shall be easy for me from today.</p><br>

<p>I will be desired, appreciated and abundantly rewarded in the mighty name of Jesus Christ my Lord and saviour. I believe Jesus Christ has given me authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt me. Every evil covenant against me and my family, I cancel you today and forever in the mighty name of Jesus Christ my Lord.</p><br>

<p>In the name of Jesus Christ my Lord, I break the power of the devil over my children’s life, and I claim their salvation and deliverance from laziness and wickedness. I condemn every prejudice, injustice and discrimination against me and my family in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. </p><br>
        
    <p>Because of the covenant I have with God sealed with the precious blood of Jesus Christ my Lord, no evil covenant can be against me and my family no matter who made it in Jesus mighty name. God Almighty Has blessed me and no power can reverse it. I am a son of God and I have overcome this world and all its wickedness. Greater is He who is in me than the devil who is in the World. I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthen me within.</p><br>

<p>I AM Strong and courageous for the Lord my God is with me wherever I go. He will never live me nor forsake me. I believe in Christ Jesus; I am the light of the world and the salt of the earth. I am a son of God, born again by the Spirit of the living God.</p><br>

<p>I believe I am Redeemed, sanctified, justified and cleansed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ my Lord and saviour. I believe Because of the covenant I have with God sealed with the precious blood of Jesus Christ my Lord, no weapon fashioned against me and my family shall prosper and I condemn every tongue that rises against us in judgement. This is my right as a son of God Almighty, the creator of the earth. Holy Father, I come to your holy presence this morning in the name of Jesus Christ my Lord and saviour. Have mercy and compassion on me and bless me so that I also can be a blessing to my generation.</p><br>

<p>Fill me with your power (wisdom, knowledge, understanding and the anointing to set the captive free from all oppression of the devil). Empower me, O Lord, to walk before you and be perfect according to your riches in glory by Christ Jesus. Give me I pray, O Lord my God, the grace to walk in your righteousness. I pray O Lord for the grace and power to walk before you and be perfect. I pray Holy Father that you will give me the grace and the power to to love righteousness and hate wickedness. ..</p><br>

<p>I ask in the name of Jesus Christ my Lord and God. I pray that the God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory give unto me the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, that the eyes of my understanding being Enlightened, that I may know how to preach the gospel in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p><br>

<p>For this reason I bow my knees to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ from whom the whole world derived its name that He would grant me, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in my heart through faith, that I being grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height– to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that I may be filled with all the fullness of God. </p><br>
