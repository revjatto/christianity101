    <h3>THE EXCHANGE MADE AT THE CROSS</h3><br>
        
       <p>Jesus was punished that we might be forgiven.</p><br>

<p>Jesus was wounded that we might be healed.</p><br>

<blockquote>Jesus was made sin with our sinfulness that we might be made righteous with His righteousness.</blockquote>

<p>Jesus died our death that we might receive His life.</p><br>

<p>Jesus was made a curse on the cross that we might enter into the blessings of Abraham whom God blessed with all things.</p><br>

<p>Jesus endured our poverty that we might share His abundance</p><br>
        
        <p>Jesus bore our shame that we might share His glory.</p><br>

<p>Jesus endured our rejection that we might have His acceptance with the Father.</p><br>

<p>Jesus was cut off by death that we might be joined to God eternally.</p><br>

<p>By taking our place on the Cross, Jesus purchased for us eternal life and fellowship with the Father. He exchanged death for life, health for sickness, blessings for curses and eternal life for eternal death, for us.</p><br>
