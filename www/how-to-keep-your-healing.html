        <h3>HOW TO KEEP YOUR HEALING</h3>
        <p>Never agree with your feeling regarding your health. let the Word of God cancel all negative words or feelings. Speak only the Word of God.</p><br>
         <p>(The Word of God, spoken in faith in the Name of Jesus, has the power to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles.)</p><br>
         <p>Jeremiah 23:28-29  “Let the one who has my word speak it faithfully …”</p><br>
         <p>[29] “Is not my word like fire,” declares the LORD, “and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?”</p><br>
         <p>Isaiah 55:10-11…[11] so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.</p><br>
         <p>When you speak the Word of God, you are tapping into limitless power!</p><br>
        <h3>Confess the Word Daily:</h3>
         <p>I am an overcomer and I overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of my testimony. (Rev.12:11)</p><br>
         <p>The LORD God in my life is Mighty; He will save, He will rejoice over me with joy; I will rest in his love, He will joy over me with singing. (Zephaniah 3:17)</p><br>
         <p>And it shall come to pass today, that the burden of sickness shall be taken away from off my shoulder, and his yoke from off my neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing. Therefore I command every yoke of the enemy to be lifted off my life now in the name of Jesus my Lord.</p><br>
         <p>Christ has redeemed me from the curse of the law. Christ has redeemed me from sickness; Christ has redeemed me from spiritual death; Christ has redeemed me from depression.  For poverty He has given me wealth; for sickness He has given me good health; for death he has given me eternal life. It is true unto me according to the Word of God. I have joy, peace and abundant life in Christ Jesus.</p><br>
        <p>Romans 8:11 “The Spirit of God who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in me, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to my mortal (Natural, Earthly) bodies through His Spirit who dwells in.</p><br>
